/**
 * CSS code for animating a box with various animations.
 * 
 * The .box class defines the styling properties for the box element.
 * It has a height of 100px, width of 300px, pink background color, and a border radius of 15px.
 * 
 * The box element is animated using three keyframe animations:
 * - fontAnimation: Animates the font size of the box from 20px to 40px.
 * - colorAnimation: Animates the background color of the box from green to blue to red.
 * - widthAnimation: Animates the width of the box from 10px to 400px.
 * 
 * Each animation has a duration of 3 seconds and an ease-in timing function.
 * The fontAnimation starts immediately, while the colorAnimation starts after 2 seconds,
 * and the widthAnimation starts immediately.
 * All animations are set to repeat infinitely and alternate between the initial and final states.
