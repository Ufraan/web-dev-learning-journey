    from {font-size: 20px;}
    to {font-size: 40px;}
}


animation: This is a CSS property that allows you to create animations on elements. It specifies the name of the animation that will be applied to the element.

@keyframes: This is a CSS rule that defines a set of styles to be applied to an element at specific points during an animation. It is used to define the animation's behavior over time.

myName: This is the name of the keyframe animation. It can be any valid identifier and is used to reference the animation later when applying it to an element.

from: This is a keyword used within the @keyframes rule to define the starting point of the animation. In this case, it sets the initial font size of the element to 20 pixels.

to: This is another keyword used within the @keyframes rule to define the ending point of the animation. It sets the final font size of the element to 40 pixels.
