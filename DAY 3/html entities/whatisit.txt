HTML ENTITIES

an html entity is a piece of text ("string") that being with an ampersand(&) and ends with a semicolon(;).

used to display reserved characters (which wouldotherwise be interpreted as HTML code), and invisible characters (like non-breaking spaces).

can also use in place of characters that are difficult to type with a standard keybaord

browser interprets them and reders correct characters


example - for less than (<) we use &lt;
example - for greater than (>) we use &gt;
example - for space ( ) we use &ngsp;
example - for ampersand (&) we use &amp;
example - for double quotes (") we use &quot;
example - for a heart (cannot be printed by a normal keybaord, other examples sun, arrow, cloud, etc.)
we use &hearts;
